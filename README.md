# Gladiator Game
This is a simply game that is turn based between two players. Each character is controlled by text input. 

# Set up
Each player is given a Name, health, rage, high damage and low damage. 

# Player abilities 
Each player can do the following: 
* slash
* stab
* sling
* heal
* taunt
* quit

# How to play
The player, whose turn it currently is, will input a key that represents the ability they want to do. Player 1 would for example input 't' for the ability taunt. 
_If a player attacks and gets a successful hit than their rage is incresed by 15._ __If a player attacks and get a critical hit then their damage output is doubled and their rage is set to 0.__ 
The higher a persons rage the more likely a crit hit is likely to happen, because of this have 100 or higher rage will guarantee a crit. 
Players take turnsattacking each other until one palyer's health reaches zero.
